# logstash-kafka

logstash-kafka is now part of the logstash core project.  It will be released with the 1.5 version of logstash.  Thank
you for your support.  My goal is to close out tickets here but for the most part, issues and problems should be
resolved via:

  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/logstash-users The logstash-users mailing list is extremely active and I 
  participate especially in Kafka troubleshooting/discussion there.
  
  * IRC: #logstash on irc.freenode.org
  
  * If you really have an issue that you can't resolve via the mailing list or IRC channel, try posting an issue to
  github.  Please make sure that issues are actually software issues, not configuration issues as those should be left
  to the mailing lists and IRC. https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues

You can also find the last version that I released here: https://github.com/joekiller/logstash-kafka/tree/v0.5.2

I will continue helping with the plugin and readying for the next version of Kafka with the jruby-kafka library.
